Hello there ! 

Welcome to my space, if you are here maybe you are lost... mmh ok maybe you are not so let me introduce myself.

I'm **Anas Asmi**, based in the baguette country , I'm not that old and I love all things refer to IT, in particular by the DevOps world. I like breaking routine and add improvement in general.

> Laziness is my biggest strength... for automation ofc :)

Otherwise, I'm an open minder, I like share experience with people like eating some new food or discover new experience ! My hobbies are sport and... yes food again i love making food and eat too :o)

I hope you enjoy your stay !

Anas.
